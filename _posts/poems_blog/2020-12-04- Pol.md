Who gave you the right to force me\\
To comply with everything you said \\
All this bending backwards\\
Is a constant pain in my neck\\
Silence and agreement correlate\\
But mistaken for being causate \\
We're good at petting leeches \\
But that's our private business\\

Stuffing diseases\\
In a wrap of promises\\
Blinding lights on our face \\
To hide your blood stains \\

Who permitted breaking the ladder\\
While we climb this wall of separation \\
Fake grass looks far more greener\\
Than the one in my garden \\

Hate prepared as smile\\
Served with religion as side\\
But we are cavemen\\
We like the old ways\\

Surround with controversies those who don't obey\\
Burn the innocent with the wicked to increase your personal stats\\
Now you promise for development and advance the upper class\\
And you fix all your mistakes by chanting the name of Raam\\
\\
Now who gave you the right to burn the \\
witches that don't agree\\
When judgement sits besides you \\
Anyone can be guilty \\

Law and order into water\\
Watch the flame extinguish\\
Silencing million fires\\
That marched against hypocrites \\

Disregard the bottom half and ensue chaos in the belt\\
One-thirds criminal and almost all of them insane\\
Sickening all the cultivators to the point they kill themselves\\
And discussing in comfort how mangoes can be ate\\

So tell me\\
Who gave you the right to poke your fingers\\
In the eyes of the innocent \\
You're just a passing phase who will \\
Cease to exist in the next wave \\

Now find a place to hide in disguise \\
Fade into oblivion for you own sake\\
Look yourself in the mirror\\
See the monsters that you tamed\\

Ban everyone who respectfully questions your faith \\
Start hitting anyone that doesn't stand for the state\\
Lure the fourth-fifths in believing rest are bad\\
And murder all those who don't follow your stance
