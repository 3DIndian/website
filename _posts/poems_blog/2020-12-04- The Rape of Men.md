Questions will never be answered\\
For a simple thought that's engraved\\
In the minds of billions of people\\
There's nothing called rape of a man\\

How will she do it to you?\\
You definitely had a hard on\\
You should have enjoyed the moment\\
You just added one more to your score\\

You are the powerful gender, right?\\
Why didn't you stop her?\\
Oh you say she was manipulative\\
Maybe you gave her signals\\

Bro! Just take a chill\\
You have just gotten yourself lucky\\
I've been craving to have sex\\
Since I was thirteen\\

Grow some balls, it's all cool\\
It was a few years ago man\\
Why would you destroy a woman's life now \\
You were okay with it then\\

Are you an idiot?\\
Nobody will believe a thing\\
Instead you'll be in jail\\
Understand reality, be pragmatic \\

Why would you say this? \\
Women can't be an oppressor\\
Would you have reacted the same \\
If I told this about your sister? \\

It's a good thing that you were raped \\
I mean all men are pigs\\
Your rapist just ended patriarchy \\
Your fragile ego hurts when I say this? \\

You must have started this \\
You must be drooling for her \\
You must be asking for it \\
She just did you a favor \\

Women are divine and pure\\
Why would she do such a thing? \\
It might be that for attention\\
You brought up all of this \\


Invalidated by everyone I just can't understand\\
Is it wrong to believe that I was molested\\
Should I feel good that I got her wet?\\
And should I feel lucky that I got "laid"\\

I didn't know what was happening \\
How did my body betray me? \\
I was supposed to control my senses\\
Then how did I let her get in \\

I should run to the loneliest place\\
At least no one will hear my cry\\
But I am a weak person and I don't\\
Have the balls to say goodbye\\

Should I just keep living in trauma\\
'Cause when I told my therapist\\
They told me to go to someone  \\
Interested in listening to bullshit\\

I have stopped trusting the system\\
I have stopped feeling ashamed\\
When you spit the truth they will say\\
There's nothing called rape of a man\\

How do I feel about it? \\
Well I don't feel a thing anymore \\
Maybe there's a reason I\\
Live behind the closed doors \\

I singled out a whole gender \\
For that I apologize \\
It took some months to realize that\\
Half the world shouldn't be marginalized\\

The world would be a better place \\
If we try to understand \\
Things happen to everyone \\
Men can also get raped
