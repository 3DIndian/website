I ate my first pizza when I was 11 years old. During that time, eating outside was a fancy thing for our family. I still remember the once in 6 months moments, where we would go to the only big restaurant in my hometown. I had the experience of tasting my first pizza with my aunt, who used to live in the biggest city in my home state. I didn't find anything 'fancy' about it. I always wondered what was the craze about. Time passed, and I went for my undergraduate in engineering, still unaware of what is pizza (I didn't even know what was Baskin-Robbins at that time). 

The first two years of undergrad were pretty normal in terms of 'pizza' interaction. I was not a pizza lover by any sorts, it was just a delicacy that I would sometimes eat because all my friends would want to eat it. During this time, I got into watching movies and would eat uncountable number of Kurkure packets with Milano cookies. I slowly started unraveling the 'western' world view (more specifically American), and how Americans do things. Watching a ton of movies, gave me sense of accomplishment, I could participate in conversations with my friends and show off the depth of my knowledge of cinema. Eventually, someone suggested me 'Pulp Fiction', which I added to my list of movies. This was the time when I would typically watch movies with 2 of my friends, and we three, would always end up ordering a pizza, because in my head, that was the 'American' way to watch a movie.

Pulp Fiction gave my pizza eating habits a roll, initially I would just eat pizza and drink water on the side to wet my throat. But, after watching the iconic Sprite 'ad' in the movie, my brain associated eating pizza with drinking Sprite. I did like the combination, but my love for Sprite might be due to my preconditioning into believing that Sprite is good with pizza. And to this date, I used to drink Sprite with pizza no matter what. But after reading the book 'Predictably irrational' and 'Advertising shits in your head', I realized how I was manipulated into buying countless Sprites. Pizza now doesn't feel complete without Sprite. We all think we can go back to more 'simple' lifestyle (eating pizza with water in this case) whenever we want, but I find it almost impossible to do so. 

A small advertisement in a movie which was hyped my friends went on to define my pizza eating habits for the next 4-5 years of my life. We think we have grown smarter to avoid the advertising on our face, but we still fall victim to countless marketing schemes (subconsciously, if not consciously) on a daily basis. 

How do you like your pizza? ;)
